Code Practices
- Slogans
    - YouAren'tGonnaNeedIt - build what you use
    - DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork - just make it work
    - MoSCoW: Must, Should, Could, Won't - tell what you'll do
    - incomplete tests are better than none
    - Review (Publish) Frequently
- Tests
    - factored/readable
    - good test names
    - comment reason for test
    - raise the reason for failed assertion - know what component failed
    - easy to run (even installed: green congredi)
    - easy to maintain - when code changes, only that bit of the test needs to change
    :Right BICEP:
        - Right (correct behavior)
        - boundary conditions
        - (if/else/members
        - Cross-Check with other means
        - force errors
        - Performance
    - specify by example: build in runnable code
    :MIT:
        - simple & clean implementation/interface
        - correct API I/O
        - consistent & uniform style & docs
        - complete (all expected cases)
- Mock Oracles
    - 3rd party get/set, dependencies
    - inspectable/logging object
    - give all good / bad outputs we want
    - transient vs persistent
