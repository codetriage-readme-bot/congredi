There's definitely room for help with this project. Here's a list of roles
I can't quite do on my own:

# Documentation Clarifiers
Nag and demand that documentation areas be improved

# Beta Testers (Users)
People to use the stuff and complain about features

# Unit Testers
Find ways to break the software

# Crypto Nerds
Tell me when I'm being stupid

# Knowledgable Helpers
Random pieces that I don't know how to solve efficiently. Possibly google.
