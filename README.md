`Congredi` is a python program that allows a community to help
individuals write changes to repositories of text, that are then
voted on by organizations to find a consensus.


Think that's useful? Give it a try! If you have any feature requests or questions,
hop on over to gitter & waffle. I'm looking for contributors on some issues.

The build status is misleading, if you've got python 2.7, it should work.
