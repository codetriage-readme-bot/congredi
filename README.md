# Congredi
> a law-via-cryptography application

Congredi is a Twisted protocol for groups to representationally agree on things.

This application uses DHT/.onion rendesvous to provide peerage, and some DB.

This is the functionality for how they'd talk together, not how a client
would go about using it, or a provider scaling it. I leave that to you.

Hopefully, with any luck, the files written here will be well-documented, unit
tested, & cohesive/decoupled.
