BREACH/CRIME security exploits?
    try to only send bigger obfuscated streams through the protocol?
    pad everything into oblivion?
    send random syncing packets when not busy?

    Omptimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (2 oracles)
    all-or-nothing-transform
    no partial decryption

pre-shared keys (re-establish connection)

replay attacks
    sign time+nounce, session symetric keys
MITM
    mac (keyed hash)
    GCM
    all-or-nothing-transform
session fixation - JWT (signed token with an expiry)
client-side encryption
    storage-nodes-cannot-grab
storage?
    encrypted disks, mostly
priveledges
kleptographically
    non-random encryption (compromised CSPRNG)
post-quantum crypto (ring learning with errors) - add homomorphic
