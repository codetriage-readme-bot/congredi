The crypto involves:

* threshold-signature OpenPGP for jurisdiction appointments
* threshold-encrypted Secure Secret Sharing for jurisdiction admin
* Shuffle-Sum for private vote results
* OpenPGP signatures for public polls
* OpenPGP Key Signing & keyservers for authorizations
* Tor & WebRTC for peer communications

A deeper look at the methodology:


* [non-coercion](zero Knowledge)
* [distribution](Chained Data)
* [identity](Sybil Attacks)# Network verification processes

1. Possession of a particular onion address (activity)
    * Method: actively online, ranking of a fraction (successes / tries)
    * replay-proxy attacks possible
2. Possession of a public key (signed challenge)
    * Method: send challenge nounce, request it be signed, validate
    * Shor's Algorithm / RSA Factorization
    * Could swap to ECC, then it has its own ECDL
3. Proof of Stake (ownership of a vote / issue / poll datum)
    * request proof that a transaction came from that node?
    * Could lead to favoritism
4. Chain of Trust (you trust your introductory nodes more)
    * method: ranking out from a trusted node, halving, small fraction alloted to un-trusted nodes
    * leads to coordinated-synchronization (half sybil) attacks (bots all have same data)
5. Sync Tests (they have what you need when you need it)
    * method: rank query-bounce of a node (successes / tries)
    * vulnerable to coordinated-syncrhonization (half sybil)
6. Hash/Scrypt Tests (GPU/Memory based)
    * difficulty goals generated by the network (fudge factor)
8. Limited resources (ownership of an IP address?)
    * impossible re: feasible to make new Tor nodesoverlays: LUKS, Cjdns, Tor
secure the filesystem: user-keychain + passphrase -> AES Cipher + block headers (gzip, integ, permissions separations)
secure the network: DHT (routing/rendesvous) 6 hop rendesvous circuit 2:1 onion/garlic routing,
    partial deniability network routing
secure the filesystem: key-torrent-striped, H(H(H(m))) group encryption (depending on jurisdiction)
    partial deniability block storage (fs priority to network of trust for proposed forks + new content)
secure the blockchain: proposed forks (diff-hash) -> sig+threshold vote -> blockchain
keyword/meta search is possible through any of the jurisdictions you have access to.
