You are responsible for the use, replication, and adaptation of these tools. How you chose to use, study, share, or improve it should benefit others to whatever moral philosophy you ascribe to. I cannot prevent you from bad judgement. Remember that, in terms of security, you shouldn't hide its problems. I would suggest reproducible builds of all the components, unit tests, uniform code-styling, and documentation.
